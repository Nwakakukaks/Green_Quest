# Green Quest
Green Quest is built to promote a green future
Green Quest helps to promote and accelerate the adoption of green energy sources, to combat climate change and create a sustainable future by creating a fun and engaging approach. Participants will engage in various activities and initiatives to reduce carbon emissions, increase renewable energy usage, and raise awareness about the importance of transitioning to a green energy economy.

## Current Climate Challenges:

- Carbon Emissions: The excessive release of greenhouse gases, primarily carbon dioxide, from burning fossil fuels for energy production, transportation, and industrial processes contributes to global warming and climate change.

- Deforestation: The clearing of forests for agriculture, logging, and urbanization leads to the loss of valuable carbon sinks, biodiversity, and disrupts ecosystems, exacerbating climate change.

- Water Scarcity: Climate change affects water availability, leading to droughts and water scarcity in certain regions, which impacts agriculture, ecosystems, and human livelihoods.

- Extreme Weather Events: Rising global temperatures contribute to more frequent and severe extreme weather events like hurricanes, droughts, floods, and heatwaves, causing significant damage and loss of life.

- Loss of Biodiversity: Climate change affects ecosystems and accelerates the loss of biodiversity, disrupting ecological balance and reducing resilience to environmental changes.


## How a Green Quest Helps:

- Behavior Change: By presenting users with daily green quest, the app encourages individuals to adopt sustainable habits, such as reducing energy consumption, minimizing waste, conserving water, and embracing eco-friendly transportation options.

- Tracking and Progress: Green Quest tracks users' participation and progress in completing green challenges, offering a sense of achievement and motivation. Users can monitor their carbon footprint, water usage, waste reduction, and energy-saving efforts.

- Community Engagement: Green Quest fosters a sense of community by allowing users to connect, share experiences, and collaborate on environmental initiatives. It can include features like forums, social sharing, and local events to encourage collective action.

- Tokens and Rewards: By incorporating gamification elements like rewards (MATIC) the app can make green challenges more engaging and enjoyable. Users can earn tokens by participating in quest thereby creating a fun and rewarding atmosphere.

3. Members join the challenge. Also share it with their friends if the challenge rules motivate them to do so.
4. Participants fulfill all conditions and mark the challenge as completed, which will be verified by smart contracts and oracles.
5. After the deadline, the community finalizes the challenge, and each participant with a verified completion will receive a part of the prize pool.
6. Eventually everyone is happy, and the community becomes more engaged.

## Next Steps

Tips and Resources: integrate practical tips, tutorials, and resources to support users in adopting sustainable practices. This can include information on energy-efficient appliances, eco-friendly products, sustainable travel options, and local recycling programs.

Impact Measurement: Build a dashboard that quantify and showcase the collective impact of users' green actions, such as the amount of CO2 emissions reduced, water saved, or waste diverted from landfills. This helps users understand the significance of their contributions.

Partnerships and Sponsorships: collaborate with environmentally conscious businesses, organizations, and brands to offer rewards, discounts, or donations to users who complete challenges, creating additional incentives for participation.
