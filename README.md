# Green Quest
Green Quest is built to promote a green future. Our innovative app is designed to accelerate the adoption of green energy, combat climate change, and create a sustainable future. Sign up and Engage in exciting Quests and initiatives that reduce carbon emissions, promote renewable energy, and spread awareness about the urgent need for a green energy economy.

## Current Climate Challenges:

- Carbon Emissions: The excessive release of greenhouse gases, primarily carbon dioxide, from burning fossil fuels for energy production, transportation, and industrial processes contributes to global warming and climate change.

- Deforestation: The clearing of forests for agriculture, logging, and urbanization leads to the loss of valuable carbon sinks, biodiversity, and disrupts ecosystems, exacerbating climate change.

- Water Scarcity: Climate change affects water availability, leading to droughts and water scarcity in certain regions, which impacts agriculture, ecosystems, and human livelihoods.

- Extreme Weather Events: Rising global temperatures contribute to more frequent and severe extreme weather events like hurricanes, droughts, floods, and heatwaves, causing significant damage and loss of life.

- Loss of Biodiversity: Climate change affects ecosystems and accelerates the loss of biodiversity, disrupting ecological balance and reducing resilience to environmental changes.


## How a Green Quest Helps:

- Behavior Change: By presenting users with daily green quest, the app encourages individuals to adopt sustainable habits, such as reducing energy consumption, minimizing waste, conserving water, and embracing eco-friendly transportation options.

- Tracking and Progress: Green Quest tracks users' participation and progress in completing green challenges, offering a sense of achievement and motivation. Users can monitor their carbon footprint, water usage, waste reduction, and energy-saving efforts.

- Community Engagement: Green Quest fosters a sense of community by allowing users to connect, share experiences, and collaborate on environmental initiatives. It can include features like forums, social sharing, and local events to encourage collective action.

- Tokens and Rewards: By incorporating gamification elements like rewards (MATIC) the app can make green challenges more engaging and enjoyable. Users can earn tokens by participating in quest thereby creating a fun and rewarding atmosphere.

## ðŸª„ How does it work?

1. Organization creates a series of green quests, defining the quest duration and pool prize for winners paid out in MATIC
2. After that, shares the link to the quest.
3. Anyone can join the challenge and also share it with their friends.
4. Participants fulfill all conditions and mark the challenge as completed, which will be verified by smart contracts and chainlink oracles.
5. After the deadline, the organization finalizes the quest, and payout is processed automatically by chainlink keepers to each participant with a verified completion.

## Technology Stack

- NextJS - used for the frontend application
- Chainlink Keepers - Used to automate payouts after quests are completed
- Chainlink's price feed contract to obtain current MATIC/USD exchange rate for accurate payout to quest winners.
- Chainlink Oracles is used to verify the involvement and activities of participants through smart contracts
- solidity - for the contract 
- IPFS - used for decentralized storage
- Polygon - Green quest is deployed on the polygon blockchain

## Next Steps

Tips and Resources: integrate practical tips, tutorials, and resources to support users in adopting sustainable practices. This include information on energy-efficient appliances, eco-friendly products, sustainable travel options, and local recycling programs.

Impact Measurement: Build a dashboard that quantify and showcase the collective impact of users' green actions, such as the amount of CO2 emissions reduced, water saved, or waste diverted from landfills. This helps users understand the significance of their contributions.

Partnerships and Sponsorships: collaborate with environmentally conscious businesses, organizations, and brands to offer rewards, discounts, or donations to users who complete challenges, creating additional incentives for participation.
